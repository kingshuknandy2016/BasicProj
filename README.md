# BasicProj

Our project follows the ***TDD(Test Driven Development)*** approach where a set of test is written for a specific functionality,by using the ***TestNg Framework*** and each test is anotated by the **@Test** Annotation

It is a ***Maven*** based **Selenium JAVA** project, where ***Maven*** has been used as the ***build management tool*** to manage all dependencies and plugins.
Here we have followed the ***Page Object Model*** to maintain the various pages of our application.

We have executed our tests using ***Maven Surefire Plug-in***. This plug-in is used during the test phase of software build lifecycle to execute tests. In order to run the test case we have to run the command ***mvn clean test***.
